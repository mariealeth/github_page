I hold a Master of Engineering (diplôme d'ingénieur) from Ecole Centrale Paris with a specialization in civil engineering, as well as a Professional certification in Data Science with OpenClassrooms.

I have worked as a works supervising engineer and then sales representative in the construction industry, and more recently as a mathematics teacher in a private secondary school. I have lived in New York for one year and in London for six years.
