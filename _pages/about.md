I hold a Master of Engineering (diplôme d'ingénieur) from Ecole Centrale Paris with a specialization in civil engineering, as well as a Professional certification in Data Science with OpenClassrooms.

I started my career as a Construction Site Manager in a construction company and then transitioned into a construction sales representative. Later on, I worked  as a mathematics teacher in a private secondary school. I am also the mother of two children and have lived abroad for several years, including a year in New York and six years in London.
